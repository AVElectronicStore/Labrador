This is just a prototype design optimized for homemade pcb fabrication.
The pcb design and BOM is different from "Tinylab_proto1", but the schematic is mostly Compatible.
nevertheless it has been tested and functions properly but you need to program atmel usb dfu bootloader first to allow firmware flashing from Desktop App.
Use of the crystal oscillator is optional and requires firmware modification.
