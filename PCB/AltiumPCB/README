Altium PCB designed by Ele4nor based on the original EspoTek KiCAD design.

This is just a prototype design optimized for homemade pcb fabrication.
The pcb design and BOM is different from "Tinylab_proto1", but the schematic is mostly Compatible.
Note that the small designators are NOT ideal and they're there for pdf only reference.
nevertheless it has been tested and functions properly but you need to program atmel usb dfu bootloader first to allow firmware flashing from Desktop App.
Use of the crystal oscillator is optional and requires firmware modification.
